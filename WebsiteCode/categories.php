        <p>Using a standard dictionary and a crossword puzzle format, lettered tiles are used to form words
            in this simple but absolutely classic board game. Strategic placement of tiles on bonus spaces
            awards the biggest bounty of points and all the usable letters on the board can be combined and
            extended to enlarge point totals. Letter tiles have points assigned to them, with common letters
            with lower points and rare letters with larger point totals. This point system rewards not only
            lengthy words and large vocabularies, but also short words that use uncommon letter combinations.
            The players left after the winner uses all their letter tiles are ranked according to the leftover
            letter totals, the one with the most losing.</p>

        <p>A game dating back to 1903, Monopoly is a family multi-player classic, with a board, set pieces,
            two stacks of cards, and a bank of cash (the famous “Monopoly money”). Play is advanced by the
            throw of dice and the game is known to last for hours. After a while of gameplay the board becomes
            a maze of rent to pay or collect and cards to collect with good and bad fortunes. Players can land
            in jail and when a full board rotation is completed, $200 are collected. Property ownership can be
            enhanced with the iconic greenhouses and red hotels, but if renovations costs are due, this can also
            backfire. </p>

        <p>A simple goal of acquiring and defending territory launches into a strategic military gem with Risk.
            Appealing to players of all ages, Hasbro’s dice rolling war game hits themes of diplomacy and conquest
            and will go down in history as one of the most popular board games with a major fan base of enthusiasts.
            Pieces range from foot soldiers to infantry to artillery, each assigned with increasing point totals. These
            pieces occupy and defend territory against other players. As one conquers an entire continent, a larger point
            per turn is rewarded. There are various options for shorter or longer gameplay, and players can test their luck
            in the game by opting for a dice-determined “battle” if they can match the set pieces in a territory, which allows
            an under-resourced player to compete against a more robust army. The last player standing wins. Global War has never
            been so much fun and what seems to be a simple set of pieces and rules quickly becomes an intense test for critical
            reasoning, risk assessment, and strategic judgment. Risk also teaches basic geography and could serve a wonderful,
            albeit bellicose, introduction to world history. There are numerous replications of Risk, based on multiple themes and
            branding, and several other classic games owe their existence to the popularity and wit of Risk.</p>
